# Dungeons and Dragons online platform :dragon_face:

## Intro
D&D has been a window into social interactions for many a nerd since the distant ages of the 1970s, and now using the tools invented by the very same nerds, the D&D experience can expand far beyond a single physical tabletop.

With the arcane arts of microservices, we can create a scalable, easily maintainable, and fault-tolerant online platform, bringing a new dimension to the classic game.

## Assesing suitability
1. **Modular game logic:** The whole D&D game process is already modularized, as it easily separates between: Game Master and the Players themselves, thus creating a service to handle each part of the game is a logical follow-up.

2. **Scalability:** Part of the game such as campaign making, character creation/registration, or ongoing matches may have different loads. Microservices would make possible scaling each component independetly, thus  assuring an optimal resource allocation.

3. **Resilience:** If one service, or instance of a service goes down, the game will not be affected, and the problem will be dealt with quetly, minimizing any disruptions.

4. **Easily updated/expanded:** It is easier to implement new features (such as rules, or creatures, or a whole new edition of D&D) in a microservice architecture.

## Similar products

Most online multiplayer games (League of Legends, Fortnite, etc) use an architecture based on matchmaking, and creating a new child instance of the service for each game session.

## Service Boundaries
The two services in this architecture can be defined as such: 
- **Authentication Service**

This service would be responsible for player authentication, character creation, customization, etc.

- **Game Session Service**

This service will be responsible for handling each game session, combat, NPCs, etc.

## Technology stack & Communication Patterns

- Python (Flask) - for writing the 2 services.
- Node.js - for the Gateway, the Service Discovery and Load Balancing.
- MongoDB - for the service databases.
- Redis - for the shared service cache.

The microservices are communicating between themselves synchronously using REST-APIs, and asynchronously when it comes to caching in the redis db, and load balancing.

Additionally the user will employ websockets for real time communication.

## Deployement and Scaling

The project is deployed using docker-compose, and the compose yml document. Each Docker container was tested using the Docker Desktop app.

## Laboratory 2 updates

<img src="PAD2.PNG">

1. Adapt the circuit breaker to ensure Service High Availability
2. Use Prometheus and Grafana for logging and aggregation.
3. Implement microservice-based 2 Phase Commits for an endpoint that create changes more than in one database.
4. Implement cache hashing and high availability (if won't shoot for a higher mark).
5. Update Databases by implementeing redundancy/replication and failover, as well as a Data Warehouse.
